first of all create a folder for your project's sounds
then put inside this folder:
your song/s	;exported as asm files from arkos tracker
your song's configuration files ;exported as asm files from arkos tracker. if you don't put them then the full version of the player will be used

playerAkg.asm	;one of the Aarkos players you can find in the folder "players"
rasm.exe	;assembler thant can compile arkos sources
disark.exe	:disassembler that will give you a plain z80 asm file
ffpasm.asm	;well, you can name it as you like, actually it means Freedom Fighter Physical asm and this is the configutation file needed to assemble using rasm. here you can set options like hardwarew used, rom or ram player and more
this file	;so you can do copy/paste to prompt shell of subsequent commands

cd pathofyourproject		;move to your project folder


rasm ffpasm.asm -o uniFF -s -sl -sq		;ffpasm should be your project config file name; uniFF should be the base name of a files group: bin(ary) and sym(bol). this will assemble your songs (included in config file, wacth inside it the way to do it, it is full commented) using Rasm


Disark uniFF.bin disFF.asm --symbolFile uniFF.sym	;this will disassemble on plain z80 asm (we haven't used parameters here) your bin file (uniFF.bin here) to a disassembled one (disFF here, but you'll chose for a good name) using the symbolfile we created before (when assembling) to put labels in the source. Label will help you if you want to split player and songs (to put them in other source zones)

So you have only to modify your asm config file (ffpasm, here) in the way that is explained in comments (really easy, few parameters and basically are already set by me, you have only to set the address of 256bytes ram buffer)
